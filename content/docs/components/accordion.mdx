### Classic Accordion

A clean, unified list design where items are stacked within a single container, separated by subtle borders. Ideal for Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) or simple data lists.

### Split Accordion

A modern variation where each accordion item is a distinct, separated card. This layout adds visual weight to individual sections and works well for settings panels or feature breakdowns.

import SplitAccordion from "@/components/phexarui/accordion/split-accordion";

<Preview link="accordion/split-accordion">
    <div className="w-full">
        <SplitAccordion />
    </div>
