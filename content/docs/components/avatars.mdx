### Detailed Popover

A modern "squircle" avatar that reveals detailed user information on hover with a smooth spring animation. Perfect for author bylines, team grids, or admin panels where context is needed without clicking.

import DetailedPopoverAvatar from "@/components/phexarui/avatars/detailed-popover-avatar";

<Preview link="avatars/detailed-popover-avatar">
    <div className="flex justify-center w-full py-10">
        <DetailedPopoverAvatar />
    </div>
</Preview>

### Magnetic Stack

An overlapping stack of avatars that react to cursor interaction with a "magnetic" lift. It automatically handles the `maxVisible` count and displays a dynamic `+N` indicator for the remaining users.

import MagneticStack from "@/components/phexarui/avatars/magnetic-stack";

<Preview link="avatars/magnetic-stack">
    <div className="flex justify-center w-full py-4">
        <MagneticStack />
    </div>
</Preview>
