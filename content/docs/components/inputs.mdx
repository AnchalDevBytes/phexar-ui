### Shimmer Input

A high-end input field that features a moving gradient shimmer on its border when focused. Perfect for login or payment fields where you want to draw attention.

import ShimmerInput from "@/components/phexarui/inputs/shimmer-input";

<Preview link="inputs/shimmer-input">
    <div className="w-full flex justify-center py-4">
        <ShimmerInput label="Email Address" placeholder="name@example.com" />
    </div>
</Preview>

### Floating Label

A modernized version of the classic floating label pattern. Using spring physics, the label moves smoothly out of the way when the user interacts with the field.

import FloatingLabelInput from "@/components/phexarui/inputs/floating-label-input";

<Preview link="inputs/floating-label-input">
    <div className="w-full flex justify-center py-6">
        <FloatingLabelInput placeholder="Full Name" />
    </div>
</Preview>

### Smart Textarea

An intelligent text area that provides real-time feedback. It includes a subtle character count indicator that turns red as the limit approaches, and a visual progress ring.

import SmartTextarea from "@/components/phexarui/inputs/smart-textarea";

<Preview link="inputs/smart-textarea">
    <div className="w-full flex justify-center py-4">
        <SmartTextarea placeholder="Write your bio here..." />
    </div>
</Preview>
