### Multi Stream

A horizontal scrolling rail designed to showcase multiple items at once. Perfect for product collections or feature lists, it includes logic for infinite looping and distinct hover states.

### Accordion Gallery

A space-efficient gallery that uses flex-box animation. Panels remain compressed until hovered, at which point they expand smoothly to reveal details and background imagery.

import AccordionCarousel from "@/components/phexarui/carousel/accordion-carousel";

<Preview link="carousel/accordion-carousel">
    <div className="w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto py-6">
        <AccordionCarousel />
    </div>
</Preview>
